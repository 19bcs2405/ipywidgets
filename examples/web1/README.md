# Ad hoc widget manager for using `jupyter-js-widgets` in non-notebook, web context

## Description

This directory is an example project that shows how to use the
Jupyter widgets library in a pure JavaScript context.

This example implements a custom specialization of the base widget manager
provided by the `@jupyter-widgets/base` library (just like the notebook extension
provides a specialization for the notebook context).

This example is meant to demonstrate how to create an ad-hoc widget manager.
For more sophisticated examples including communication with a Python kernel,
see other examples.

## Try it

1. Start with a repository checkout, and run `npm install` in the root directory.
